# Data Cleaning
## Purpose
The purpose is to propose an end-to-end data cleaning workflow, in practice of
the data cleaning and provenance tools and techniques introduced in course CS513.
## Database Selected
The database we used is NYPL-menus. It is a project named “ What's on the Menu ”
NYPL (New York Public Library) labs launched in late April, 2011. The project aimed at
scanning and transcribing all the 45,000 menus contained in the New York Public
Library’s menu collection dating from the 1840s to the present. Till now, a quarter of
them have been digitized and collected in this database.
The database contains 4 tables: Menu, MenuPage, MenuItem, and Dish.
## Phase 1 initial assessment
- Select the dataset
- Describe the dataset: structure, schema and content
- Identify obvious data quality issues
- Develop use case and data cleaning goals
- Develop work plan
## Phase 2 Data cleaning
- Use OpenRefine and Python to clean the dataset
- Developing a Relational Schema and check integrity constraints with SQL
- Creating the Workflow Models with OR2YWTool and yesWorkflow
## Phase 3 Use case demo with tableau and documentation
- Write final report



# Data Visualization
## Purpose
This purpose is to create a narrative visualization implemented as an interactive web
page, using the knowledge of visual communication and narrative structure learned in
course CS416. 
## Design
